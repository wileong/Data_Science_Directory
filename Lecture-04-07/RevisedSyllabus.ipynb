    "     * Handle messy data, such as raw text.\n",
    "     * Handle complex data, such as hierarchical data stored in XML or JSON format.\n",
    "     * Handle large data, such as that stored in a database.\n",
    "     * Summarize data using the split-apply-combine paradigm.\n",
    "     * Design effective visualizations."
