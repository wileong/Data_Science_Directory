    "Please fill out the [course evaluations](http://sail.calpoly.edu/). This is the first time that I've taught Data 301 and only the second time it's been taught. Your feedback will determine how Data 301 is taught in the future -- not just by me, but by other professors as well.\n",

    "- Next Tuesday, May 30.\n",
    "- The in-class project will be a prediction competition.\n",
    "- In the first 80 minutes, you will complete a few straightforward tasks: build classification models (e.g., logistic regression, $k$-nearest neighbors, decision trees), use cross-validation, estimate precision / recall, etc. 5/10-now\n",
    "- In the last 90 minutes, you will work with a partner (of your choice) to build the best predictive model that you can.\n",
    "- The three teams that achieve the smallest prediction errors (on held-out data) will earn extra credit.\n",
